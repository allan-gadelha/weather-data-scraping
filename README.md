# weather-data-scrapping
 Data Scraping using Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup and Pandas

Project Overview

The Weather Data Scrapping Project is an initiative dedicated to obtaining comprehensive weather data from the website Climate Data (https://en.climate-data.org/). The project focuses on a span of 30 years, from 1991 to 2021, to gather valuable insights into weather patterns for 350 destinations worldwide.

Objectives
Data Source: Exclusively extract weather data from Climate Data to ensure consistency and reliability across all destinations.

Variable Focus: Concentrate on five key weather variables: Min. Temperature, Max. Temperature, Precipitation/Rainfall, Average Sun Hours, and Rainy Days.

Temporal Scope: Cover a span of 30 years (1991-2021) to capture long-term weather trends and variations.

Dataset Format: Compile the acquired weather data into a structured CSV/Excel format, emphasizing the selected variables and maintaining clarity for easy analysis.

Selected Variables

The project specifically collects and compiles data for the following weather variables:

Min. Temperature: Recorded in both Celsius (째C) and Fahrenheit (째F).

Max. Temperature: Captured in both Celsius (째C) and Fahrenheit (째F).

Precipitation/Rainfall: Measured in millimeters (mm) and inches (in).

Average Sun Hours: Calculated in hours, available for the years 1999 to 2019.

Rainy Days: Representing the number of days with recorded rainfall.

Note: Although temperature data is available in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, the client has opted for only Fahrenheit to be included in the final CSV file.

Implementation

Web Scraping: Utilize web scraping techniques to extract targeted weather data from Climate Data.

Data Cleaning: Ensure data consistency and accuracy by handling any missing or inconsistent values.

Temporal Range Processing: Filter data within the specified temporal range (1991-2021) to maintain relevancy.

Dataset Compilation: Aggregate the cleaned weather data into a structured CSV/Excel format, focusing on the selected variables.

Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation detailing the data collection methodology, selected variables, and any specific considerations taken during the process.

Future Enhancements

Consider potential future enhancements, such as incorporating real-time updates or expanding the dataset to include additional weather parameters.

The Weather Data Scrapping Project aims to deliver a high-quality dataset that meets the client's specifications, offering valuable insights into the selected weather variables for 350 destinations over a span of 30 years.
